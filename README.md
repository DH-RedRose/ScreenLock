Screen lock is a simple application with the sole goal of locking a user's mouse to their screen. Having very few customizations options the user can:

Change hotkeys 
Set UI or the Lock functionality to the Hotkey
Change padding to allow for desired screen lock space


The application is simple and designed to not do much outside of the above functionality,  it saves users settings in Documents \ ScreenLockOverlay that can be deleted by the UI in the application or manually at any time. 

The UI is basic and has few options as mentioned before

Lock/Unlock - Sets the mouse lock on and off
Hotkey Actions: UI/Lock - Sets the hotkey to toggle the UI or Lock
Minimize - Pushes the application into your system tray
Exit - Saves user settings and closes the program

Padding + / - changes the screen padding this is set to a Max of 20 and a Min of 0

Set Hotkey: This button allows the user to change their hotkey to any combination or individual ket they would like. (Alt key is not Available)
